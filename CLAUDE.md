# Claude Code Instructions

## Git Commit Policy
**NEVER include AI attribution in commit messages.**
- ❌ Do NOT add "Generated with Claude Code"
- ❌ Do NOT add "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
- ✅ Use standard conventional commit format only
- ✅ Keep commits professional and attribution-free

## Context7 MCP - PRIORITY TOOL
**ALWAYS use Context7 MCP for dependency and code lookups when available.**

When working with:
- Unknown dependencies or packages
- Library documentation
- Framework APIs (SvelteKit, React, etc.)
- TypeScript types and interfaces
- Third-party integrations
- Code examples and patterns

**Context7 provides the most up-to-date and accurate documentation.**
Use Context7 FIRST before searching web or making assumptions.

## Task Master AI Instructions
**Import Task Master's development workflow commands and guidelines, treat as if import is in the main CLAUDE.md file.**
@./.taskmaster/CLAUDE.md
